# TaySachs-Classification
This is a simple Tay Sachs classification program. I have also included all the datasets I used. The datasets were created from raw data obtained from NCBI site at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/. Searched using "Tay Sachs" and "HEXA".
Please contact me if you have any questions.
